Chrome extension to keep track of information during a game of dominion on
dominion.isotropic.org.

The extension keeps track of:
- # of cards each player has
- # of points each player has
- # of cards each players has set aside

These are displayed in the bottom beside the chat box.

Known issues:
- players with spaces in their name are not supported
- possession is not supported
- vineyard, duke, and gardens are not implemented
- doesn't always realize a new game has started (reload page to fix)
- code is a horrible hack :P
- probably lots of other stuff :)

Future direction:
Once this has stabilized to have fewer known issues, I'd like to turn it into
something like an IRC bot. It can announce itself and the command to query for
status at the beginning of the game. Then both players can take advantage of
it. Thanks rrenaud for the idea.
